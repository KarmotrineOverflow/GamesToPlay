                <h1>Hey there!</h1>

                <p>My name is <b>John</b> and as an avid gamer, I have loads of games I want to experience playing.
                With that, I came across this problem where I forget what game I want to play next and why I want to play it,
                causing me to lose track of my coveted video games thus installing random ones. This leads to my disappointment
                in the random game I installed as it is not the one I am looking forward to play.</p>

                <p>To solve that, I made this simple website that keeps track of what I have played, games I want to play, and my thoughts on them.
                    I see this website as a little time capsule as well, providing my thoughts at the time when I recently finished a game and loved it.
                </p>

                <p><b>I'm looking forward to all the nostalgic moments and experiences I will encapsulate in this little website!</b></p>
            </div>
        </>
